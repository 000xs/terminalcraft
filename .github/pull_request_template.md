3. **Briefly describe what your project is. What makes it unique?**
   _(Provide a brief description of the functionality or innovation)_
EzEssay provides a way to organize your essays for college apps. Using tools like Google Docs are fine, but a CLI tool is much more efficient and has a nicer asthetic. It's also fully customizable. 

On top of organizing essays, it also helps fetch previous essays you've written based on the similarity of prompts using HackClub's free DeepSeek API. Even cooler is that it can write new (AI-generated) essays since it can interact with all your previous essays

2 (I think), but I posted on slack for more

5. **On What operating systems have you tested this project?**
   _(MacOS/Linux/Windows)_
Windows, but it's deployed as an npm package, so it's cross platform

6. **Does your project include a Readme file with instructions on how to use it?**
   _(Yes/No)_
Yep
