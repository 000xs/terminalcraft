Based on the documentation, I understand that Veritaminal is a terminal-based game where:

1. Players act as border control agents verifying documents for travelers
2. The game uses AI-generated content (names, documents, backstories)
3. Players make decisions (approve/deny) based on evolving rules
4. An AI assistant named "Veritas" provides hints and narrative commentary
5. Player choices affect the story through a branching narrative system
6. The game is built in Python and uses the Google Gemini AI API

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup
First, we'll create the basic directory structure as outlined in the documentation:

```
veritaminal/
├── game/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── gameplay.py
│   ├── narrative.py
│   └── ui.py
├── tests/
│   ├── test_gameplay.py
│   └── test_narrative.py
├── setup.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### Step 2: Define Requirements
Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies:
- google-generativeai
- prompt_toolkit
- python-dotenv (for loading environment variables)

### Step 3: API Integration (Placeholder)
Develop api.py with placeholders for AI integration:
- Configure the Google Gemini API
- Create functions for generating text
- Include error handling and fallbacks

### Step 4: Gameplay Mechanics
Implement gameplay.py:
- Document generation logic
- Verification rules system
- Scoring mechanism

### Step 5: Narrative System
Create narrative.py:
- Story state tracking
- Decision impact logic
- Game-over conditions

### Step 6: Terminal UI
Build ui.py:
- Document display functions
- User input handling
- Interface styling

### Step 7: Main Game Loop
Develop main.py:
- Initialize game components
- Orchestrate gameplay flow
- Handle command processing

### Step 8: Testing
Create basic unit tests:
- Test document generation
- Test narrative branching
- Test user input validation

### Step 9: Packaging
Set up setup.py for installation and distribution.

## Placeholders for AI Implementation

Throughout the code, I'll indicate where you'll need to implement the real AI functionality with comments like:

```python
# TODO: Replace with actual Google Gemini API implementation
# This is a placeholder for AI-generated content
```

This implementation plan follows the structure outlined in the documentation while allowing you to plug in the real AI functionality later.
